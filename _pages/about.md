I’m a senior undergraduate at IIT Gandhinagar. I’m into developing games, VFX, editing videos, computer graphics, and simulations. I've developed games that have over 447k+ downloads on Play Store and played 2M+ times. You can find the projects that I've worked upon in my undergraduate years in the `projects` section.

If you want the source code/build of any of these you can contact me. Few of them are available on my [Github](https://github.com/aniketrajnish). The design & development documents of these projects can be found in the `docs` section.
