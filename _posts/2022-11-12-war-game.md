* The game would be a choice-based text-only HTLM5 game.
* People would find themselves admist a war situation
* They would be given with constant choices like looking for inventory or helping an ally.
* Correct set of choices and wise decision making would add up on your points and help you win.
* Carelessly choosen options would decrease your points and you'd eventually lose the war.
