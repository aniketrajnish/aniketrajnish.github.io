 *  Developed in a team of two with me looking after streaming backend, UI, and video editing, VFX and compositing.
 * A platform for completely interactive movies
 * The movies will proceed in the way you want them to
 * Your choices form one of the many perspectives
 * You take control of the protagonist
 * Everything is streamed online so you only use your data for what you want
 * Try the demo [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makra.Holly)
 * Developed an asset that allows one to stream a video in small chunks accroding to his choices.
