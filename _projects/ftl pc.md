Corona has taken over the world. Vaccines have failed to stop it. Scientists have figured out that the only option left is to travel back in time and stop the root cause of the virus. To 'REWIND' the time one has to achieve the speed of light. Can you? 5/5 people who play-tested it couldn't do so :P
* Developed in a team of three with me looking after game mechanics, lighting & shaders, UI design, sound design, and the overall production of the game.
* Play [Here](https://makra.itch.io/faster-than-light)
* Made in 7 days for the 2020 Brackeys Game Jam (3rd biggest gamejam on itch with 9k+ participants)
* Game ranked #71 in Audio category and #132 overall.
* Programmed every mechanic & enemy AI of the game.
* Looked after the lighting and shaders used in the game.
* Implemented bullet time mechanics.
* Implemented player physics from scratch that would allow the player to move in space independent of the world's timescale.
