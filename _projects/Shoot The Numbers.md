Developed for prototype testing to CrazyLabs as a part of PPP (Pay-Per-Prototype) deal. The CPI test video delivered can be found [here](https://youtu.be/OnMOxLZIVHE).
* Developed in a team of four with me looking after game mechanics, lighting & shaders, and the overall production of the game and CPI video.
* Optimized multiple navmesh agents for mobile devices.
* Wrote a shader that supports both transparency and interpolation between two colours.
* Wrote swerve mechanics trending in hypercasual games these days.
* Wrote mechanics for algebraic gates trending in hypercasual games these days.
