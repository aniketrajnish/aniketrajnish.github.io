 It is being developed by [19 Souls on Board](https://www.19soulsonboard.com/about), a team of 19 student developers from Cohort 18 at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy on the downtown campus of the University of Central Florida. I assisted the team as a technical artist this summer.
* Developed in a team of 19 with me looking after particles, shaders, and a few gameplay mechanics.
* The development update to the game can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S1EbyBRVhw). 
* The repository containing my contributions to the project can be found [here](https://github.com/19SOB/ucf-fiea-19sob-capstone-project-temp).
* Curated development logs and documentation to my contributions can be found [here](https://makra.wtf/docs/2022/soul-shard/).
* Became competent with the workflow principles followed in Unreal Engine (Materials, Lighting & Reflections, Blueprinting, Niagara, Landscape sculpting, Post Processing, Quixel).
* Developed a dynamic footprint system for main characters.
* Developed VFX effects like stylized fire & flames, smoke, debris & flames using the Niagara system.
* Developed a dynamic snowstorm system.
* Implemented rope physics for cables.
* Implemented a loading screen.
