* Developing this project in a team of four with me looking after game mechanics, lighting & shaders, WEBGL backend, and the overall production of the game.
* As a part of the project course DES 499, we are expected to design and develop an interactive environment of the various yantras at [Jantar Mantar](https://www.jantarmantar.org/) for the user to navigate through it for the [MHRD](https://www.education.gov.in/en)
* This course was taken under the guidance of [Prof. Sameer S. Sahasrabudhe](https://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~s1000brains/Sameer_Sahasrabudhe_Mar2014/Home.html)
* The repository of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/aniketrajnish/DES499-JantarMantarReconstruction).
