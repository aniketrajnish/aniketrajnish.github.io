Developed for prototype testing to CrazyLabs as a part of PPP (Pay-Per-Prototype) deal. The CPI test video delivered can be found [here](https://youtu.be/XJnFSqy4siI).
* Developed in a team of three with me looking after game mechanics, lighting & shaders, and the overall production of the game and CPI video.
* Worte ragdoll crowd control mechanics.
* Wrote canon projectile mechanics.
* Wrote a low poly water shader.
* Optimized clouds by using raymarched clouds instead of particle based clouds.
