Developed for prototype testing to CrazyLabs as a part of PPP (Pay-Per-Prototype) deal. The CPI test video delivered can be found [here](https://youtu.be/PZkQhBOjrHU).
* Developed in a team of two with me looking after game mechanics, lighting & shaders, and the overall production of the game and CPI video.
* Wrote texture masking algorithm to erase / paint textures over meshes.
* Rigged a horse model.
* Optimized fluid simulation for mobile devices.
