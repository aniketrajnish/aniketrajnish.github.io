**Brackeys Gamejam 2021.1** 
* Total Particpants: 10000+
* My Rank: 22 (Innovation), 44 (Game Design), 71 (Overall)

**About the game:** 
* Two opposites is a game about the journey of two opposites (characters with mirrored controls) separated by a mirror.
* Players need to solve puzzles to escape the mirror world and finally meet each other. However, the challenge lies in the fact that they can only solve these puzzles together.
    
**My Responsibilities:**
* Led a team of three and looked after game mechanics, lighting & shaders, UI design, sound design, and the overall production of the game. Made within a week
* Programmed every mechanic of the game which included, but not limited to mirror movement, multiple camera setup, etc.
* Formulated and developed a [2D Lighting System](https://makra.wtf/docs/2022/two-opoosites/#10-2d-lighting-system) in C# for Unity using raycasts and Unity started official support for it in a later update.
